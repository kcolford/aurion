Aurion
======

A pacman repo containing a subset of AUR packages that I build and
serve at https://kcolford.com/aurion/.

Anyone can maintain their own packages using a fork of this
repository.

This is primarily useful for abandoning AUR helpers and just use
`pacman`, the greatest package manager in the world.
